# 📊 Test Coverage Report

> Automated code coverage analysis generated on every push to GitHub

## Status

✅ **Workflow Active** - Test coverage is automatically collected and reported on each commit

## Coverage Report

The detailed HTML coverage report is generated by the [GitHub Actions workflow](https://github.com/dertnius/kafka-producer-balanced/actions/workflows/test-and-coverage.yml) on every push.

Once the workflow completes successfully, the full interactive coverage report will be available at:
- **Location**: `docs/coverage/` directory
- **View**: Check GitHub Actions runs for detailed logs

## Running Tests Locally

```powershell
cd MyDotNetSolution
dotnet test Tests/MyDotNetApp.Tests/MyDotNetApp.Tests.csproj `
  --configuration Release `
  --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage" `
  --results-directory:TestResults
```
